A base code which I almost use in every project I work on!
It shows how to build awesome project with Coroutines & Dagger by Clean Architecture in Kotlin!
This way you don`t need to repeat the same code in different parts of your project over & over.

[merge](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Alesh17/BaseProject/master/additional/git_merge.png) and 
[rebase](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Alesh17/BaseProject/master/additional/git_rebase.png). 
The main difference of rebase: is that it rewrites the history of the project, creating new commits for each commit in the original branch.
